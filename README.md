# bash-2-cmdprompt
scripts to make Linux bash prompt look more like Windows Command Prompt 
this will make your bash prompt more like the Windows Command Prompt in look and feel.
you can choose to use it with zsh in the `install.sh` script but its likely not going to work with oh my zsh themes very well
