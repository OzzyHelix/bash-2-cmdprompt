# bash-2-cmdprompt
scripts to make Linux bash prompt look more like Windows Command Prompt 

this will make your bash prompt more like the Windows Command Prompt in look and feel.

you can choose to use it with zsh in the `install.sh` script but its likely not going to work with oh my zsh themes very well

# Installation
run `install.sh` as your user or
run `cat BASH2CMDPROMPT >> ~/.bashrc` the shell of your choice

I am only experimenting with bash and zsh but you are free to try it out on other shells
