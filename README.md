# bash-2-cmdprompt
scripts to make Linux bash prompt look more like Windows Command Prompt 

this will make your bash prompt more like the Windows Command Prompt in look and feel.

you can choose to use it with zsh in the `install.sh` script but its likely not going to work with oh my zsh themes very well

# Installation
run `install.sh` as your user or
run `cat BASH2CMDPROMPT >> ~/.bashrc` the shell of your choice

I am only experimenting with bash and zsh but you are free to try it out on other shells

# But Why Tho
I largely made this after ricing xfce to look and feel like XP with modifiying the bash command line with edits to the bashrc file and 
I thought it was funny so i don't expect people to use this seriously as it is kind of cursed. On the off chance you want to use this it works very well on bash and sort of on zsh any themes with oh my zsh override the C:\ thing in the `BASH2CMDPROMPT` file
